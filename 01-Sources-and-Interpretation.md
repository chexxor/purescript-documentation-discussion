# Sources and Interpretation

## Defining Our Terms

**Definition**:
A "source" is any source of data that makes a truth claim (it claims that something is true. Whether that statement is actually true needs to be explored).

The goal of this step is to do the necessary work to make it easier to do the enxt step, defining the context/narrative.

**Examples:**
- A blog post
- A tweet
- A talk
- A conversation in a forum, chatroom, etc.

**Gathering Sources**:
One first gathers sources without bias as to who said what or where it comes from and categorizes them. At this stage, no assessment of the sources or interpreting what they say is done.

**Interpretation**:
After gathering as many sources as is reasonable in the allotted time period, one begins to assess a source and give it weight. Some sources bear more "weight" than others. Some are more subjective (biased, unbalanced in assessment, misinformed, etc.) while others are more objective (real evidence/arguments that must be addressed with real answers). Once assessed, one interprets the main themes/ideas that one hears the source communicating.

The rest of this document should be a list of sources, followed by an interpretation of that source that highlights the main ideas it makes.
