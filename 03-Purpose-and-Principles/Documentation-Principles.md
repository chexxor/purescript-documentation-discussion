# Documentation principles

- There are many types of applications that can be built with PureScript, each of which should have documentation. The group of people who write each type of application is best suited for managing its documentation.
- All types of PureScript applications have pre-requisite knowledge, and the set of this knowledge which is common across all PureScript applications should be managed by the group of PureScript groups, an entity which we will name the PureScript organization.

- Documentation projects, and projects they depend on, are likely maintained by volunteers. We should appreciate contributions made by volunteers who find the time to contribute. If you're disappointed by a project's progress, you should try to find time to realize the change yourself and contribute it. If you need help contributing, ask for help in an issue or pull request on the project or in a PureScript user group.

(Need to think about what other documentation principles there are. Group organization principles are also relevant.)
