# Purpose and Principles

## Defining Our Terms

**Definition**:
A "purpose" is one or more statements that summarizes the 'why' behind what one is trying to accomplish. When problems arise, it defines what gets done and what does not by asking the question, "Does doing X help accomplish our purpose?"

A "principle" is one or more statements that summarize 'how' one accomplishes the purpose. When something can be accomplished in multiple incompatible ways, it defines guidelines and priorities for which approach is taken and which approaches are ignored.

The goal of this step is
- to define the core values by which any contributors will abide when contributing any work towards this effort. Those who agree with the purpose but disagree with these principles will need to start their own projects. This "division" can be healthy and welcomed.

**Examples**:
- I need to tell you a secret. I could walk to your office and tell you face-to-face, but I might be interrupting you (core value: respect your time/schedule) or another person might overhear me (core value: only you and I should know this secret). So, I could instead create a secret language (i.e. cipher) that only you and I understand and hand you a note with the encrypted message on it as I walk by your office. In this last example, all my core values are upheld.
