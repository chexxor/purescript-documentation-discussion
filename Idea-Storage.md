# Idea Storage

This file just lists a number of ideas we want to remember for later when going through this methodology from the top-down.

- The core libraries' documentation needs to be improved. This will likely include adding documentation where none exists, explaining the pre-reqs for understanding the code and where to find such things, examples of how to use the function, etc.
- Some libraries' documentation are not currently uploaded to Pursuit due to the Bower bug. This might be something we want to fix for very important projects, though it might also be ultimately solved by changing how Pursuit works.
