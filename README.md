Read these files in numerical order. The methodology's terms, definitions, and examples are provided in the first section of each file.


## Project Management

### Create a Work Item

Open an issue to indicate some task that needs to be done. If it's a new source of data, include it as a link.

### Start on a Work Item

If an issue is not assigned, assume anyone can work on it.

1. When you're ready to start working on an issue, assign the corresponding issue to yourself. When you do this, you are committing to completing the work.
2. If a file for that source does nto already exist, create one.

### Working on a Work Item

1. Do all work related to that source in that file. This is to prevent merge conflicts from slowing our analysis down.
2. Push any changes directly to `master`.

### Completing a Work Item

Once you have finished your initial work...
1. Move the file to the corresponding "For [other person]" folder to indicate that this person can review your work.
2. Push this final change to `master`
3. Mark the corresponding issue as closed with a comment that includes the specific commit hash that has the final commit in your work.
