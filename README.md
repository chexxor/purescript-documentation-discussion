## Discussion Framework

Let's use a methodology, suggested by Jordan, to organize/guide the discussion.

- [Presuppositions] We presuppose that
- [Authorities] certain “authorities” (i.e. sources of data) are true and accurate, which
- [Interpretation] we interpret in various ways and use to
- [Context/Narrative] describe the current context/narrative, which
- [Purpose] a) calls for some purpose to be fulfilled
- [Principles] b) whose fulfillment must abide by certain principles / core values,
- [Outcome] c) where “success” for this part of the context/narrative is a clearly defined ‘X’.
- [Brainstorm] We brainstorm various ways to achieve X and decide to take some Path/Plan to get there which abides the most with our principles and strategically uses our limited resources,
- [Next Actions] delegating specific actions that can be done “now” and which do not require anything else to be done before they can be done (e.g. waiting for someone to resond).
- [Current Actions] When we have time and the mental energy to do so, we do our next action and slowly make progress.
