### Opening Comment

A number of comments were made, but the one that caught our attention was started by this one.

> Are the elm overlords still hell bent on "thou shalt program our way or not at all"
> Because that kind of dogmatism is a complete show stopper for languages that want to be deployed on even medium term projects.

> This is one of the reasons why I chose Purescript for my team's projects.

- A PureScript user prefers PureScript over Elm because they don't like a language which dogmatically enforces a certain way of programming.

> Also it's got a more complete type system, a simpler FFI, and compiles to less javascript.

- A PureScript user believes PureScript's FFI is simpler than Elm.
- A PureScript user believes PureScript compiles to smaller amounts of JS than Elm for the same thing, making pages load faster than Elm-written ones.

> This is not to say that Elm is bad. O think it's great as a path into FP, and in fact _was_ my path in.

- A PureScript user entered PureScript after going through Elm.

> But it does limit you in what you can do and learn.

- A PureScript user feels limited by Elm's type system.
- A PureScript user believes that a language can limit what you can do and learn, and is reason for leaving the language.

> Also, Purescript has this interesting property of being hard to learn (because it is powerful), but dead simple to use (because it compiles to JS). So you only really get stuck on figuring out how to do things in PS, as opposed to how to get PS working, and therefore every time you get unstuck, you have leveled up. So it's hard, but rewarding.

- A PureScript user believes that learning PureScript is hard to learn, and the reason is it is powerful.
- A PureScript user believes that using it is dead-simple because it compiles to JavaScript (because it is readable?).
- A PureScript user has trouble figuring out how to solve application problems in PureScript, which is a reason for why PureScript is hard to learn.
- A PureScript user feels rewarded when using PureScript because the primary sticking points are figuring out how to do things *in* the language, rather than figuring out *non-language* problems.

> I'm probably off topic by now, but I do think that Purescript in the frontend is a better option for solid application development.

- A PureScript user believes that PureScript is good for solid development of frontend applications.

> Purescript looks like a great language and if you want to dive into the deep end of typed FP, then it looks like an excellent choice. One reason I went with Elm for our in-house customer support app, was because of the simplicity of the language. It does result in more boilerplate but I don't think the project would have been successful if the learning curve was steeper.

- A non-PureScript user prefers a simple language with a gradual/short learning curve and is willing to compromise on the quantity of manually-written code to have it.

### Comment

>> [Context](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17126216) One of the reasons behind the poster saying it is that the interop between Elm and vanilla JS is quite painful especially compared to the likes of BuckleScript.

> PureScript's interop is fairly easy, too. Just foreign imports, which I personally prefer over mixing languages like you might do in BuckleScript/ReasonML with their brace syntax (or might not), but it's still better than this weird message passing thing that Elm does.

- A JavaScript/React/PureScript user believes PureScript's FFI is fairly easy and is better than ReasonML's and Elm's FFI.
