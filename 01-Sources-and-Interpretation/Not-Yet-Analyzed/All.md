## List of Yet-To-Be-Analyzed Sources

The following quotes were found by searching the PureScript Discourse, Twitter, and Google for PureScript documentation, impressions, and experience reports.

> Core PureScript has great documentation (see the PureScript book, the Halogen guide and example repos). However, most of the rest of PureScript learns from Haskell by having mediocre documentation. You’ll need to become familiar reading types and briefly checking source code to see what’s going on. That said, we’ve rarely had trouble with documentation; most functions are self-explanatory and the functional programming Slack is great for filling in the gaps.

> I think PureScript is missing a full webapp step-by-step tutorial (front, back, database, mails, authentication, forms, validation…)

> I tried PureScript, first impression was really good, but I was lacking some guidance for e.g. free monads etc. So deeper concepts :-) tips?

> Building Purescript Puzzler was a great learning experience, especially since I’m not the most experienced web dev. I sunk my teeth into a few cool libraries and got my first real taste of FRP outside of toy examples. However, I still feel like thar be dragons lurking in the shadows with this approach, and the apparent lack of complex examples is not reassuring. I think part of the problem with this is the absence of wrapper libraries that make common tasks easier, which inhibits exploration.

> I felt the same way. Learning PureScript wasn't difficult for me but I already knew Haskell. I can't imagine what it's like for someone who doesn't know Haskell to learn PureScript, because there are very few tutorials designed for that audience. Most of the docs on PureScript are very much "reference" style so you have to already know what you're looking for to even find them.

> It also feels like PureScript is unmaintained. I tried PS out twice over a year or two and the docs were more or less the same (very sparse).

> A big issue for me, too, was that I felt like I was looking at Haskell docs to figure out how to do things more than I was using PS documentation. At that point, why not just use a Haskell compiler that targets JavaScript instead? And, if I end up using the FFI to include the majority of my JS code, can’t I just write functional JavaScript code in the first place and cut out the middle man?

> Also, Purescript has this interesting property of being hard to learn (because it is powerful), but dead simple to use (because it compiles to JS). So you only really get stuck on figuring out how to do things in PS, as opposed to how to get PS working, and therefore every time you get unstuck, you have leveled up. So it's hard, but rewarding.

> However, I'd only put PureScript into production if I had people with Haskell experience and a good amount of time to become contributors. The community is friendly to beginners, but there's a vast amount of background that isn't explained in a systematic way, and the community standards for documentation and infrastructure just aren't up to the level we've come to expect from systems like Elm or Elixir or even Clojure.
