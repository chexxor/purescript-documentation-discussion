> I think PureScript is missing a full webapp step-by-step tutorial (front, back, database, mails, authentication, forms, validationâ€¦)

> I tried PureScript, first impression was really good, but I was lacking some guidance for e.g. free monads etc. So deeper concepts :-) tips?

> Also, Purescript has this interesting property of being hard to learn (because it is powerful), but dead simple to use (because it compiles to JS). So you only really get stuck on figuring out how to do things in PS, as opposed to how to get PS working, and therefore every time you get unstuck, you have leveled up. So it's hard, but rewarding.

> However, I'd only put PureScript into production if I had people with Haskell experience and a good amount of time to become contributors. The community is friendly to beginners, but there's a vast amount of background that isn't explained in a systematic way, and the community standards for documentation and infrastructure just aren't up to the level we've come to expect from systems like Elm or Elixir or even Clojure.
