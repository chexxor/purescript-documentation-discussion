> Core PureScript has great documentation (see the PureScript book, the Halogen guide and example repos). However, most of the rest of PureScript learns from Haskell by having mediocre documentation. You’ll need to become familiar reading types and briefly checking source code to see what’s going on. That said, we’ve rarely had trouble with documentation; most functions are self-explanatory and the functional programming Slack is great for filling in the gaps.
