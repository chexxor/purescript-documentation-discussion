> I felt the same way. Learning PureScript wasn't difficult for me but I already knew Haskell. I can't imagine what it's like for someone who doesn't know Haskell to learn PureScript, because there are very few tutorials designed for that audience. Most of the docs on PureScript are very much "reference" style so you have to already know what you're looking for to even find them.

> It also feels like PureScript is unmaintained. I tried PS out twice over a year or two and the docs were more or less the same (very sparse).

> A big issue for me, too, was that I felt like I was looking at Haskell docs to figure out how to do things more than I was using PS documentation. At that point, why not just use a Haskell compiler that targets JavaScript instead? And, if I end up using the FFI to include the majority of my JS code, canâ€™t I just write functional JavaScript code in the first place and cut out the middle man?
