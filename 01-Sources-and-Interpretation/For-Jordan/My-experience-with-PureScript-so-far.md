### Blog post (new language user)

> Purescript leaves you alone in the jungle of its methods and functional gibberish. If you don’t know what a Monoid, a Foldable or a <$> is, you better learn the language with tutorial first! It feels like the language wasn’t build for programmers first, but for Haskell programmers with strong theorical background. Could you easily guess what’s the difference between a Semi-groupoid and a Monoid?

- Newcomers to the language feel antagonized by the unfamiliar concepts and language operators.
- Perhaps documentation can mitigate the confusion and anguish experienced by newcomers.
