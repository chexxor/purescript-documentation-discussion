# Sources and Interpretation

## Defining Our Terms

**Definition**:
A "source" is any source of data that makes a truth claim (it claims that something is true. Whether that statement is actually true needs to be explored).

The goal of this step is to do the necessary work to make it easier to do the next step: defining the context/narrative.

Sources can be broken into two types: primary sources and secondary sources. Primary sources are stand-alone sources whereas secondary sources are interpretations, summaries, analyzations of primary sources.

**Examples of Primary Sources:**
- An original paper that introduces some idea for the first time
- A blog post
- A tweet
- A talk
- A conversation in a forum, chatroom, etc. where one person speaks their own opinion, makes their own logical argument, etc. These statements are not interpretations of some external data.

**Examples of Secondary Sources:**
- A blog post that summarizes another blog post
- A conversation where one person uses phrases like "I remember X being true," "I think X is true," and/or "I heard someone say X is true." and these phrases are used to mean "I interpreted information in such a way that I reached some conclusion and I am stating that conclusion, not necessarily the process by which I reached that conclusion, so that you can 'check my work of logical deduction.'"

**Gathering Sources**:
One first gathers sources without bias as to who said what or where it comes from and categorizes them according to primary/secondary source distinctions. At this stage, no assessment of the sources or interpreting what they say is done.

**Interpretation**:
After gathering as many sources as is reasonable in the allotted time period, one begins to assess a source and give it weight. Some sources bear more "weight" than others (primary bear more weight than secondary). Some are more subjective (biased, unbalanced in assessment, misinformed, etc.) while others are more objective (real evidence/arguments that must be addressed with real answers). Once assessed, one interprets the main themes/ideas that one hears the source communicating.

## Sources

The rest of this folder includes a file for each source. These were found searching the PureScript Discourse, Twitter, and Google for PureScript documentation, impressions, and experience reports.

Sources are still being created and analyzed in this folder. Here are what the folders in this folder mean:

### Not Yet Analyzed

This folder includes sources that have not yet been analyzed

### For Alex/Jordan

This folder includes sources that have been done by one of us and should be reviewed by the other

### Done

This folder includes sources that have been reviewed by both of us. They will be used to define the context later.

## Source Formatting

 Each source has a file with the following contents:
- a link to the original post/comment
- a quote of the relevant parts of that post/comment and an interpretation that highlights the main ideas of the relevant parts

Since maintaining the primary/secondary source distinctions can be hard to do when analyzing/interpreting blog posts, forum comments, etc., they will not be categorized as such here.

In other words, it will look like this:
<hr>
## Source: source name

[link to the source]()

### Opening Thread
