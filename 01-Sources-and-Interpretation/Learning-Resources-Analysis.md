## Pre-existing PureScript Learning Resources

This section overviews the other learning materials that already exist in the PS ecosystem?

- Who wrote them?
- How active are the author(s)?
- What are their incentives?
- Would they want to be part of a potential documentation team?
- Who is their intended audience?
- What type of documentation is it? (i.e. tutorial, how-to, reference, explanation)

| Resource Name | Author | Activity? | Incentives? | Potential Doc Team member? | intended audience? | type of documentation? |
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| PureScript By Example | Phil Freeman | not active, but is a user of PS | help a new person get familiar with the language enough to actually build something useful | not likely due to burning out and still recovering from it among other reasons | PS learners | tutorial / explanation
| [PureScript Resources](https://purescript-resources.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) | Justin Woo | Justin is quite active in the community, but AFAIK does not contribute to his resource that frequently | probably just a way to summarize a few things for new people | not sure | new learners | mixture of how-tos, quick-starts, and some explanations
| [PureScript - Jordan's Reference](https://github.com/JordanMartinez/purescript-jordans-reference) | Jordan Martinez | frequently active on the learning resource but does not do much else for the larger community | to learn PureScript by teaching it to others via the Feynmann technique | possibly | new learners and people needing a centralized "do it all" kind of learning resource | a mixture of getting-started, how-tos, explanation, and reference; mostly explanation and reference; code-as-an-example
| [Lens for the Mere Mortal: PureScript Edition](https://leanpub.com/lenses) | Brian Marick | Not very active AFAIK; author has moved on to other languages...? | to explain how to use lenses immediately without first explaining how and why they work | people who want to understand Lenses but are afraid of them because of how complicated the types get; people who have tried learning Lenses using other tutorials and still do not understand them. | Quick Start, explanation, how to
| [A Guide to PureScript Numeric Hierarchy](https://a-guide-to-the-purescript-numeric-hierarchy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html) | hdgarrood | very active and a core contributor to the PS language and a number of libraries | to explain PureScript's numeric type class hierarchy | likely? | those who do not have a strong math background | tutorial / explanation
| [Real World App](https://github.com/thomashoneyman/purescript-halogen-realworld) | thomashoneyman | active and contributes to a number of Halogen-related projects | show that PS is a viable/better alternative to other solutions; show a fully functional, well-commented program written in FP style/concepts | not sure | people already familiar with basic FP concepts; people who want to see what "good FP code" looks like (or at least one way of writing 'good FP code') | code-as-an-example
| [MultiPac](https://github.com/hdgarrood/multipac) | hdgarrood | create a good learning resource that's also a fun experimental project | learners looking for real examples | code-as-an-example

### Learning Resources targeting different backgrounds

| Resource Name | Author | Activity? | Incentives? | Potential Doc Team member? | intended audience? | type of documentation? |
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| [Egghead.io Learn PS course](https://egghead.io/courses/professor-frisby-introduces-composable-functional-javascript) | Brian Lonsdorf | Not sure | Not sure | Not sure | Javascript developers who want to learn FP in Javascript | explanation and how-to ?
| [Outersider's Guide to Statically Typed Functional Programming](https://leanpub.com/outsidefp) | Brian Marick | Not very active AFAIK; author has moved on to other languages...? | to explain the benefits of FP programming to "outsiders," people who do not know it, without using FP jargon or the usual approach that FP people use to explain FP | Not sure, but seems unlikely | Javascript developers who want to learn Elm? Elm developers who are ready for something more powerful? | Getting Started, How-to, Explanation
