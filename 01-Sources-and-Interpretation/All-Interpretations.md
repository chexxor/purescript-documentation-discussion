- There are lots of easy documentation problems to resolve in the core documentation. [Features_You_Want_Future_PureScript_to_Not_Have]
- A PureScript user prefers PureScript over Elm because they don't like a language which dogmatically enforces a certain way of programming. [Hitchhikers_Guide_to_Elm]
- A PureScript user believes PureScript's FFI is simpler than Elm. [Hitchhikers_Guide_to_Elm]
- A PureScript user believes PureScript compiles to smaller amounts of JS than Elm for the same thing, making pages load faster than Elm-written ones. [Hitchhikers_Guide_to_Elm]
- A PureScript user entered PureScript after going through Elm. [Hitchhikers_Guide_to_Elm]
- A PureScript user feels limited by Elm's type system. [Hitchhikers_Guide_to_Elm]
- A PureScript user believes that a language can limit what you can do and learn, and is reason for leaving the language. [Hitchhikers_Guide_to_Elm]
- A PureScript user believes that learning PureScript is hard to learn, and the reason is it is powerful. [Hitchhikers_Guide_to_Elm]
- A PureScript user believes that using it is dead-simple because it compiles to JavaScript (because it is readable?). [Hitchhikers_Guide_to_Elm]
- A PureScript user has trouble figuring out how to solve application problems in PureScript, which is a reason for why PureScript is hard to learn. [Hitchhikers_Guide_to_Elm]
- A PureScript user feels rewarded when using PureScript because the primary sticking points are figuring out how to do things *in* the language, rather than figuring out *non-language* problems. [Hitchhikers_Guide_to_Elm]
- A PureScript user believes that PureScript is good for solid development of frontend applications. [Hitchhikers_Guide_to_Elm]
- A non-PureScript user prefers a simple language with a gradual/short learning curve and is willing to compromise on the quantity of manually-written code to have it. [Hitchhikers_Guide_to_Elm]
- A JavaScript/React/PureScript user believes PureScript's FFI is fairly easy and is better than ReasonML's and Elm's FFI. [Hitchhikers_Guide_to_Elm]
