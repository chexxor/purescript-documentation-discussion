# Outcome-Brainwrite-Next-Actions

## Defining Our Terms

**Definition**:
An "outcome" is a final measurable state that defines what 'extraordinary success' looks like. By 'final state,' it is not what we are striving towards (that's a purpose), but something that states what will be true by its deadline. By 'measurable,' it means there are quantitative figures that indicate how close we are to the end, whether we are 'on schedule' or not, and what are the bottlenecks slowing us down.

A "brainwrite" (similar to 'brainstorm' but fundamentally different from it) is a step where each person individually comes up with their own ideas for how to reach that outcome, starting from the outcome itself and working backwards to the current moment. This process is done individually to prevent "group think," which often stops better ideas from emerging.
All ideas are accepted at this point and no judgment is rendered. In short, assume that every idea is a 'good one' and that there are no 'stupid' ideas.
Once all have tried to come up with as many ideas as possible on their own, the group evaluates each idea with no knowledge as to who thought of it. The pros/cons of each approach are considered and then the group decides what combination of the various ideas produces the best approach to reaching the outcome. It is here where a Gantt chart can be used to track the team's progress.

Once the team has decided on an approach, the team then looks at the approach from their current place in time and determines what are the next actions they have to do to make any progress. Once identified, the team determines who is best qualified to do a next action and the deadline for getting them done.

A "next action" is the next "doable" action in the plan that will ultimately achieve the desired outcome. It has no dependencies on other things (e.g. waiting for people to respond, needing to check something first, need to do some task first, etc.). Rather, it is that "doable" task that one could do right now if
- one had all the resources (e.g. time, skills, knowledge, tools, money, etc.) required to do it
- one was in the proper location/context to do it.
- one has enough mental/physical energy to do it

Once one meets all of those 'next action' conditions, they do it and progress is made.

After one completes the current "next action," one moves on to the next "next actions." Eventually, the team will accomplish it's goals.

**Examples**:
At the end of washing the clothes, the clothes will be clean as indicated by the removal of mud that is currently on them and wearable as indicated by the fact that they are dry and hanging in the closet.
    - Thinking backwards, we will hang the clothes up in the closet.
    - Before that, we will carry them up into the room.
    - Before that, we will take them out of the dryer.
    - Before that, we will walk to the dryer when its "finished" bell rings.
    - Before that, we will do something else to pass the time by.
    - Before that, we will configure the dryer's options and turn it on.
    - Before that, we will take the wet clothes out of the washer and put them into the dryer.
    - Before that, we will walk to the washer when its "finished" bell rings.
    - Before that, we will do something else to pass the time by.
    - Before that, we will configure the washer's settings and turn it on.
    - Before that, we will put the clothes inside the washer and add some detergent.
    - Before that, we will carry our less-wet clothes from the outside to the washer
    - Before that, we will wring out the water in the clothes and put them into a separate less-wet pile
    - Before that, we will put the clothes in a bucket of water for an hour to remove the mud that was dried on them
    - Before that, we will fill a bucket with water and put the clothes inside
    - Before that, we will get a bucket

Thus, the first "next action" is to get a bucket. If we're home and we have one available, we can do it. If we're at work right now (wrong context), we will have to wait until we get home. If we are on our way home, but do not yet have a bucket, then this is actually not the "next action." Rather, the "next action" is to do something that gets us a bucket, like calling a neighbor to see if they have one or buying one at the store.


Since there may be multiple outcomes that each have their own plan for achieving them, each outcome should be defined in its own file.
