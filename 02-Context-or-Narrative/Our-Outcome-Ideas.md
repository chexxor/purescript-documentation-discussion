# Our Outcome Ideas

This small change will address the FP Slack persistence issue:
- When a question on the `#purescript` Slack channel gets answered, request the person who asked it to post the question on StackOverflow and link to the question in the chatroom.
- Then, let someone (whether the answerer or someone who saw it) "answer" that question and give credit it to the answerer.


Rather, we (non-core-contributors / users of PS) can focus on answering questions like these:
- What are the libraries that need to have their documentation improved?
    - If documented, will breaking changes outdate such documentation?
    - How hard would it be to write a small code example that shows how to use them? For example
        - [Jordan's example for how to create a tree via `purescript-tree`](https://github.com/JordanMartinez/purescript-jordans-reference/blob/latestRelease/22-Projects/src/11-Table-of-Contents/04-Tree/01-Syntax.purs#L31-L64)
        - [Jordan's example of the "hello world" program via the ReaderT design pattern](https://github.com/JordanMartinez/purescript-jordans-reference/blob/latestRelease/21-Hello-World/08-Application-Structure/src/11-Hello-World/02-ReaderT.purs)
        - [Halogen's "basic button component" example](https://github.com/slamdata/purescript-halogen/blob/master/examples/basic/src/Button.purs)
- What are "best practices" for various topics/areas? For example:
    - Guidelines for writing a good bindings library
        - How should a library author analyze the library to which they want to write bindings?
        - What are common problems such people face and their possible solutions?
- What are some of the clearest explanations of FP concepts?
    - How hard is it to port their code examples to PureScript?
    - Have people written an explanation that "walks one through" an FP paper's ideas in a clear way?
- What are common solutions to build-related problems? Where is a centralized resource that can store all of these?
    - Integrating PureScript to work with JS build tools?
    - Integrating PureScript with CI (Travis, AppVeyor, etc.)?
    - Possible "tree-shaking" approaches to PureScript and their tradeoffs?
