# Context or Narrative

## Defining Our Terms

**Definition**:
A "context" or "narrative" is a person or group of people's attempt at integrating their isolated interpretations of various sources into a coherent "story" that explains all the relevant pieces of the puzzle in a systematic way. By "coherent," we mean that it attempts to explain why one source says one thing whereas another says something that may contradict or agree with another source's statement. This coherent explanation must be reasonably inferred from sources, and objectively and fairly interpret sources. By "systematic," we mean that the final result of this work presents things in an organized manner (summaries are provided, references are sound, etc.). New readers should be able to quickly and easily understand the situation by reading through this narrative.

Also, since this is an interpretation, it risks misinterpreting things. This risk is understood and acknowledged, but one still attempts it anyways as interpretations can be refined with additional data and thoughtful arguments and counterarguments.

The goal of this step is
- to define the purposes that need to be fulfilled and how those purposes should be fulfilled (i.e. the principles by which to abide)
- to define what are the obstacles that will make it difficult to accomplish those purposes
- to define the full consequences and implications of successfully fulfilling these purposes
- to define the full consequences and implications of failing to fulfill these purposes

Lastly, it ends with a general call to action.

**Examples**:
- A friend (Source A) calls saying that their house is on fire and they need help. Another person (Source B) calls and tells you it is a prank. You have known Source A for much longer than you have known Source B. Based on past experiences, you know that Source A is probably telling the truth. You also know that Source B is a cruel person who likes to watch things burn. Since Source B does not live near Source A, you reason that Source B might have started the fire in Source A's house and is likely trying to keep you from helping Source A. You realize, that by not coming to your friend's aid, Source A may very well die. Thus, you call upon your other trusted friends for aid. You reason, "If we do not come now and help, Source A may very well die! How could we let that happen!?" Then, you travel to Source A's house armed with a weapon and some hoses.
